    "# VertiBayes\n",
    "\n",
    "VertiBayes is an algorithm that can train a Bayesian Network in a Vertical setting.\n",
    "It is implemented within vantage6\n",
    "\n",
    "## The training data:\n",
    "The training data used is the ASIA dataset (https://www.bnlearn.com/documentation/man/asia.html)  \n",
    "This is a synthetic dataset containing the following attributes: \n",
    "- D (dyspnoea), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- T (tuberculosis), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- L (lung cancer), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- B (bronchitis), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- A (visit to Asia), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- S (smoking), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- X (chest X-ray), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "- E (tuberculosis versus lung cancer/bronchitis), a two-level factor with levels yes and no.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training a Bayesian Network:\n",
    "A bayesian network is trained in two phases:\n",
    "1) Structure training\n",
    "2) Parameter training\n",
    "\n",
    "VertiBayes can handle both aspects of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, VertiBayes can train a network with a predefined structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training with a predefined structure\n",
    "Training with a predefined structure has two advantages.\n",
    "1) You can incorperate existing expert knowledge\n",
    "2) It is faster as you can skip the structure learning part\n",
    "\n",
    "Since federated learning always has an overhead when compared to central learning being able to take advantage of this is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step one: training with a predefined structure\n",
    "In the following cells we will show you a vantage6 call to train a network with a predefined structure"
