    "# Step 2: Retrieve averages\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to check which variables are available in our collaboration. As we cannot see the data, we need to get some basic information about the available data in another way. Preferably, every node should have FAIR data descriptions, but these are not always available. In this notebook, we are going to retrieve the *global* average for a specific column. This means, an average calculated over all nodes available, for a given column.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this works is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The nodes calculate the sum for a given column, and the number of values on which this sum was based\n",
    "2. The *aggregation node* calculates the sum of sums, and divides it by the count of numbers. This can be denoted as: $$ globalAverage = \\dfrac{\n",
    "  \\sum_{n=1}^{m}{S_n}\n",
    "}{\n",
    "  \\sum_{n=1}^{m}{C_n}\n",
    "} $$ where $S_n$ represents the sum of a given node, and $C_n$ represents the count of numbers for a given node.\n",
